# Overview

I am exploring the issue of inner city education (or lack thereof) and its causes. Some of the sources I have found so far, there are five, point to how increased single motherhood rates contibute to the poverty line. I hope to find sources that also address subjects such as education, limited jobs, and wealth distribution.
