I didn't realize that we had to bring *in* a source and had planned on using the PEW Research Center. I've used them in the past with great success, but today was having trouble deciding on a topic. As a result, I didn't really know what keywords to look for.

One topic idea I had was to give an analysis on the issues that plague inner city education. I knew of an article on this subject called *Planned Failure, The Plight of Inner City Kids.* 

Some of the keywords they used:inability to read, grants, books, and culture.

The author, Bob Blumenthal,wrote about this from teh perspective of a retired teacher.

This article helped guide my searches in PEW Research Center. Now, I have a better understanding of what statistics I should be looking for.
