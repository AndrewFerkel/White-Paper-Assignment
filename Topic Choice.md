For my white paper, I will be demonstrating the horrendous conditions of inner city education to teachers and faculty in other areas. My goal will be to speak to members of successful schools and convince them to partner with the areas in need by illustrating statistics that show the startling flaws of urban education.

Call to Action: Partner with instructors in the cities and help them in their endeavors to teach students who are not interested in learning at all.
