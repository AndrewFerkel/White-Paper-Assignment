# Causes of Poor Urban Education
Though many educators recognize the growing disparity between urban education and education elsewhere, many people still do not understand that the causes, largely overcrowding and poor teaching, are a natural result of the setting and must be actively fought for any hopes of success. 
In large cities, the ratio between the number of schools and population grows more drastic which in turn causes the overflow of classrooms with students. In these areas, classrooms frequently excede thirty or forty students; likewise, faculty becomes overwhelmed by the sheer number of students. Additionally, a student's propensity for success varies largely on the one-on-one interactions they have with the teacher. Another consequence of overcrowded classrooms is the lack of discipline that frequently ensues when the teacher is simply too busy to deal with everyone. Finally, struggling students in this environment rarely receive adequate attention. Consequently, standardized test scores grow disproportionate to the scores of schools in suburbs and rural areas.
Consequently, these effects of the overcrowding of the urban schools contribute to a lack of good educators in large cities; statistically, experienced teachers tend to not only have the option to teach in nicer schools, but very frequently will. This leaves the already-struggling urban schools the poor teachers to try to grasp the attention of the overcrowded classrooms. Unfortunately, this phenomenon means that while poor teachers cause poor students, poor students also contribute to the influx of more poor teachers, resulting in a *snowball effect.*
